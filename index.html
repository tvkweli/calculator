    <h1>Quantity of Caffeine Tolerated Varies Among Consumers</h1>

    <div id="byline"> by Talib Visram </div>

    <br>

    <div class="text">

      A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691513007175">2013 medical study</a> published in the Food and Chemical Toxicology journal took a sample of 37,602 people and found that the average caffeine intake was 164.5mg per
      day (and this included children, who consumed far less than adults). This works out at just under two regular cups of coffee daily.

      <br><br> This may not seem like a lot, but caffeine addiction is real, according to experts. And caffeine overdose cases come up from time to time, although professionals say that overdoses generally only occur when victims consume extreme amounts,
      rely on caffeine pills, or have pre-existing medical conditions.
      <br><br> Dr. Bruce Goldberger, a clinical, medical and forensic toxicologist at the University of Florida, said that most people who consume caffeine daily are somewhat addicted, if “addiction” is taken in its traditional definition of “when you
      don’t consume the drug, you crave it.” Goldberger said that withdrawal symptoms include headaches and fatigue, as well as feeling shaky.
      <br><br> It’s extremely hard to drink the amounts of caffeine that would cause death, partly because our bodies have methods in place to react to the detection of too much toxicity, such as nausea and vomiting. For example, it would take 149 cans
      of Red Bull to kill the average person, but nausea and vomiting would likely happen after just five, according to Ted Kallmyer, Website Editor at <a href="https://www.caffeineinformer.com/">Caffeine Informer</a>, a website dedicated to providing
      accurate caffeine information to the public. That figure is from the LD50 (or Lethal Dose 50%), the amount of a substance required to kill 50% of the population.

      <br><br> Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant. Dr. Goldberger said that means that too much would increase heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate and body temperature – and potentially lead to seizures.
      <br><br> But he said that deaths from caffeine drinks are rare, and those reported to be caused solely by caffeine are suspect. Instead, he said, they are likely due to pre-existing medical conditions. “There’s really no basis for having one or
      two energy drinks, then dropping dead. A complete investigation was probably not carried out, which would include an assessment of risk for cardiac arrhythmias, unrelated to caffeine.”
      <br><br> This can be seen in the lethal cases described on Caffeine Informer. A 30-year-old New Zealander who drank <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-21423499">10 liters of Coca-Cola</a> a day died in 2013. But the coroner could not attribute
      the death to the Coke alone.
      <br><br> A British man died in 2013 after consuming an entire tin of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/dad-john-jackson-died-caffeine-6170091">HERO Energy Mints</a>, but the post mortem showed that he was also a heavy drinker,
      and had cirrhosis of the liver, meaning the organ couldn’t absorb the stimulant properly.
      <br><br> And in 2012, a 14-year-old girl died after drinking <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/business/fda-receives-death-reports-citing-monster-energy-a-high-caffeine-drink.html">two Monster energy drinks</a>. A medical examiner said
      that she’d died from “cardiac arrhythmia due to caffeine toxicity,” but that the girl had an existing heart problem that exacerbated the reaction.
      <br><br> Kallmyer agreed that most cases point to underlying medical problems, because the doses of caffeine alone were not considered lethal. But he said there are a lot of things we don’t know about caffeine, and that the quantities tolerated
      are different for everyone. Those who are more sensitive, pregnant, have high blood pressures, and so on can be affected by smaller doses.

      Kallymer and Goldberger agreed that the most lethally dangerous products are not caffeinated drinks, but caffeinated pills. This is because the caffeine is much more concentrated in the pills, with 200mg per tablet in such brands as NoDoz, an over-the-counter
      drug. It’s easy – for those who purposely want to harm themselves, too – to take a handful of pills and consume fatal amounts of caffeine.
      <br><br> Kallymer said that there needs to be more careful restriction and regulation around caffeine, targeted not only to the average consumer but also to those more sensitive to it.
